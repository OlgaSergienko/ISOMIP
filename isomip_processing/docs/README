2 pdf and 1 tex file describing the example POP2x Ocean0 and Ocean1-4
results provided at:

Participants may wish to use the latex file as a template for their own
description.

2 python 2.7 scripts, plotMISOMIPOceanData.py and plotMISOMIPOceanMetrics.py
for plotting ISOMIP+ and MISOMIP1 ocean data. The scripts requires the 
netcdf4-python package (from https://github com/Unidata/netcdf4-python), 
numpy, and matplotlib

Usage:
python plotMISOMIPOceanData.py <ocean_data.nc> <out_image_path>

The input file <ocean_data.nc> must begin with the name of the
experiment (Ocean0, IceOcean1, etc.).  <out_image_path>
is the path where the images are stored, and will be created
if it does not already exist.

The result is one image per field per time index, named 
<out_image_path>/<field>_<000n>.png, where <field> is the name
of one of the fields in the netCDF file, as specified in
Sec. 3.4 and <000n> is a zero-padded time index.

Usage:
python plotMISOMIPOceanMetrics.py <Ocean1_result.nc> <Ocean2_results.nc> ...

This script produces plots in both png and pdf format of five metric fields
that depend only on time: meanMeltRate, totalMeltFlux, totalOceanVolume,
meanTemperature, and meanSalinity.  The plots are placed in the curent
directory and are given the names of the metric being plotted.
