    "Invalid values (e.g. field locations that lie within the ice shelf or bedrock) should be masked out using a fill value. In C and Fortran, this can be accomplished by assigning a value of NC_FILL_FLOAT. In Python, invalid data can be masked by using numpy masked arrays to assign to netCDF4 variables. We ask participants to supply monthly mean values of all time-dependent quantities (except iceDraft and bathymetry, which should be snapshots), where the values in the time array indicate the beginning of the period being averaged. Participants who\n",
    "are unable to compute monthly mean values may supply snapshots instead but should\n",
    "indicate this with their submission."
