    "\n",
    "#### 1) We need to come up with a better way to define the terrain-following coordinate. Alistar mentioned the idea of making the top layer very thick outside the ice shelf to avoid a large pressure gradient jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Issue with sponge layer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Run the 2D noIS cases for 10 years and plot the max. velo. in a log scale so we can check how energy behaves in the different setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) How do we define z* in the presence of an ice shelf? we will need to address this question at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) Run some cases with KD = 1E-6 (i.e., molecular diff.) to find hout how much vel. is generated under this condition. This will help us define how much spurious vel. we should accept in the quiet experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6) Make a plot of 1/H to check if there are closed contours. This could lead to the so-called \"Taylor Caps\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7) Issues with ALE rho.  \n",
    "       PS: I was able to get better resulls with ALE rho by using BOUNDARY_EXTRAPOLATION = True, INTERPOLATION_SCHEME = \"PLM\" and REMAPPING_SCHEME = \"PPM_H4\". Before I was using INTERPOLATION_SCHEME = \"P1M_H4\" and BOUNDARY_EXTRAPOLATION = TruFalseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee(PPM_H4 does not work in rho)."
