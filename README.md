# ISOMIP+ with MOM6
The goal of this repository is to centralize the tests, issues/difficulties and steps needed during the implementation of ISOMIP+ using MOM6 and other model components from GFDL. 

## TESTS

Quiet runs:

* **[2D without ice shelf](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/ipynb/quiet_2D_noIS.ipynb)** - added by Gustavo Marques

* **[2D with ice shelf](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/ipynb/quiet_2D_yesIS.ipynb)** - added by Gustavo Marques

* **[3D without ice shelf](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/ipynb/quiet_3D_noIS.ipynb)** - added by Gustavo Marques

* **[3D with ice shelf](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/ipynb/quiet_3D_yesIS.ipynb)** - added by Gustavo Marques

Sponge layer:

* **[2D, cold interior and cold forcing](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/ipynb/)** - added by Gustavo Marques

* **[2D, cold interior and warm forcing](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/ipynb/)** - added by Gustavo Marques

Passive tracers:

Coming soon!
