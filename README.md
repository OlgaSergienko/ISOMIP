# ISOMIP+
The goal of this repository is to centralize the tests, issues/difficulties and steps needed during the implementation of ISOMIP+ using MOM6 and other model components from GFDL. 

# ISSUES

* **[Spurious velocities in "quiet experiments"](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/spurious_velocities_quiet_experiments.ipynb)** - added by Gustavo Marques

* **[Horizontal pressure gradient errors due to the ice shelf](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/horizontal_pressure_gradient_errors_due_to_the_ice_shelf.ipynb)**: added by Gustavo Marques

* **[Inconsistency in ALE sponge layer](https://github.com/gustavo-marques/ISOMIP/blob/master/inconsistency_ale_sponge_layer.ipynb)**: added by Gustavo Marques
